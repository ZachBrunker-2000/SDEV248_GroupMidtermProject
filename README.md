Mysteries of Emberwick README
# Brief Project Description
Mysteries of Emberwick is a collaborated on, immersive mystery and puzzle game set in a fantastical version of Victorian London. Players step into the shoes of a rookie detective who is tasked with solving a myriad of intriguing cases, ranging from simple robberies, to complex kidnappings and murders.

# HOW TO PLAY
Explore:
  Dive into detailed environments to uncover clues and unravel the mysteries that lurk within Emberwick.
Interact:
  Engage with various characters, objects, and environments to gather vital information that progresses the investigation.
Collect and Use Items:
  Utilize collected items, clues, and tools to strategically unlock new leads while solving intricate puzzles.
Question Witnesses:
  Interview witnesses and potential suspects to extract valuable insights and discern truth from deception.
Accuse the suspect:
  You want to make informed decisions, and follow your instincts to accuse the correct suspect before time runs out.

The player is given an input box to choose an option that is listed based off the specific action they would like to take(I.E., Travel between different locations in a level, speak and interact with NPC's).
  Example:
    Choices:
      1. Travel
      2. Investigate
      3. Question
      4. Check Inventory
      5. Accuse.
      INPUT FROM USER: "2"
    This would then send the player into the Investigate portion for the area they are currently within.
